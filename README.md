## Knative

Knative (pronounced kay-nay-tiv) extends Kubernetes to provide a set of
middleware components that are essential to build modern, source-centric, and
container-based applications that can run anywhere: on premises, in the cloud,
or even in a third-party data center.

Each of the components under the Knative project attempt to identify common
patterns and codify the best practices that are shared by successful,
real-world, Kubernetes-based frameworks and applications. Knative components
focus on solving mundane but difficult tasks such as:

* [Deploying a container][knative-deploy]
* [Orchestrating source-to-URL workflows on Kubernetes][knative-workflows]
* [Routing and managing traffic with blue/green deployment][knative-bluegreen]
* [Scaling automatically and sizing workloads based on demand][knative-scaling]
* [Binding running services to eventing ecosystems][knative-eventing]

[knative-workflows]: https://www.knative.dev/docs/serving/samples/source-to-url-go/
[knative-bluegreen]: https://www.knative.dev/docs/serving/samples/blue-green-deployment
[knative-scaling]: https://www.knative.dev/docs/serving/samples/autoscale-go/
[knative-eventing]: https://www.knative.dev/docs/eventing/samples/kubernetes-event-source/

Developers on Knative can use familiar idioms, languages, and frameworks to
deploy functions, applications, or containers workloads.

### Components

The following Knative components are available:

* [Eventing][knative-eventing] - Management and delivery of events
* [Serving][knative-serving] - Request-driven compute that can scale to zero
